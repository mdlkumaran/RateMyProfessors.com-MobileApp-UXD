Steps:

1. Go to `key-path-scenario` folder and double click on `index.html` to go through the prototype.
2. That's it.

NOTE: The prototype uses a framework that makes Ajax requests to display different views. Testing in Safari, it works. However, Google Chrome will show the following error:

`Cross origin requests are only supported for protocol schemes: http, data, chrome, chrome-extension, https, chrome-extension-resource.`

It's probably easier to go through the prototype here:
